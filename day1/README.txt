The examples in this file are specifically for Python 2.7. 
(Most of the code will also work with earlier versions of Python 2.x, 
 but a few lines, such as the dictionary comprehension, will not
 work.) 

With the exception of the example for testing using nose, none of the 
files require 3rd party extensions. They only use the python standard
library.

Unlike numpy and scipy, matplotlib can be a little tricky to
get setup and working. For example, if you use easy_install or
pip to install matplotlib it's pretty easy for the installation
to seem to work (i.e. no errors) but matplotlib fails to plot
when you open up an interpreter. Generally the culprit seems 
to be setting the backend. Some recommendations for fixing that 
are on stackoverflow:

Also, I don't show it here, but matplotlib has a 'pylab' mode that
basically tries to be like matlab. It can be good for interactive
work and is roughly equivalent to importing most stuff from
numpy, scipy, and matplotlib into the global namespace. This means
much less typing when making plots. 

IPython also has a pylab mode that opens directly into pylab, and
it can be quite pleasant to work in. 

I have no idea how it comapres to SAGE.
